Removed dead code.</message>\n<message>Here is the changes made today\:&\#x0A;*Fixed crash when attempting to change throttle after connection without&\#x0A;a train added.&\#x0A;*Clicking a switch will toggle that switch and indicate it on the&\#x0A;screen.&\#x0A;*Huge UI cleanup and new icons/app name change.&\#x0A;*Track scaling features are offloaded to happen during train addition.&\#x0A;*Train addition now requires an angle offset, defaults to if nothing is&\#x0A;pressed.&\#x0A;*This angle is added to the read angle and works for at least two&\#x0A;rotations around each direction and still moves appropriately forward&\#x0A;and in reverse.&\#x0A;*Now ignore erroneous barcode rezeroes, if curTieCount - prevTieCount&\#x0A;simply use the curTieCount. May lose some accuracy but it will no longer&\#x0A;teleport back to the starting point.&\#x0A;*Set boolean flag inside image_view custom class, this could eventually&\#x0A;be used to handle ignoring the update train requests when dragging, did&\#x0A;not get it implemented yet.</message>\n<message>Major changes since last commit, several emailed versions detail most&\#x0A;changes, our changes in particular vs the last emailed version are as&\#x0A;follows\:</message>\n<message>Moving based around UI elements to test until the payload is up and&\#x0A;running.</message>\n<message>Combined drag and drop code along with the older control system code.&\#x0A;Working very well for controlling trains.</message>\n<message>OnTrack Controller Added a lot of selection via the image view&\#x0A;interface. Add, delete, switches and trains.</message>\n<message>Moved current to buffer and averaging this buffer over the last 10&\#x0A;iterations. Framework for receiving based on message type and start of&\#x0A;handing off current/imu computation.</message>\n<message>Created BlueTooth thread to handle receiving packets.</message>\n<message>Selectable loconet commands, along with improvements to the UI and user&\#x0A;experience.</message>\n</messages>
